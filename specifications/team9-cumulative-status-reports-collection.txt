======================================

- In the application backend area: The non-cached web service
  access changed to be cached. 

- New git directory structure and new software environment,
  which contains 2 separate parts: Client (built with Middleman

  Api, which is Rails based, without the view layer
  (https://github.com/spastorino/rails-api). Google Maps
  is used in the client. 

- Specification paper Driver-Services-phase1-general-description-v1.doc written.

- Specification paper Driver-Services-phase1-road-info-description-v1.doc written.

HTML5 course status report of weeks 14-15:
(2012-04-02...2012-04-15, the Easter vacation was in between):
==============================================================

- A Team 9 face-to-face work planning meeting held:
  Meeting date: 2012-04-04 (Wednesday)
  Meeting time: 10:00...11:30
  Meeting place: Aalto Venture Garage
  Participants: Mikael Koponen, Samuli Suortti, Kai Sjöblom

- First (Ruby based) backend version made. It can access road
  information APIs and do the SOAP-> JSON conversions. (Username
  and passford information must be edited to settings_sample.yml
  file and the file be renamed to settings.yml before usage,
  since the sensitive password data is intentionally left
  outside of the open source code version management, by
  including the "settings.yml" filename into the .gitignore file.)

- First map display functionality working.

- Application functionality and features planning continued.

- Development environment planning continued.

- AP/Kai: Web services access rights application response status:
          Temporary web service username and password got
          for the road information web services. These may later
          on change, but anyway the team can now access all
          the data needed by the application to be built.

- A short description for the 2012-04-23 level demo application
  version being written.

Coming in week 16:
==================

- AP/Whole team: Individual work to continue in the agreed
                 specialized areas.

- An initial small demo application version is to be
  prepared before midday 2012-04-23.

- In the application backend area: The non-cached web service
  access is planned to be changed to be cached, using a database.
  This will be done to avoid possible road information web
  service timeouts etc. problems for the end user.

HTML5 course status report of week 13
(2012-03-26...2012-04-01):
======================================

- Application functionality and features planning continued.

- Development environment planning continued.

- AP/Kai: Web services access rights application response status:
          an earlier related contract for Helsinki University of
          Technology was found but it was noted to be too different,
          so we will get a brand new contract paper from the web
          service provider to be undersigned. AP continues.
          Web services API specs distributed to other team members. 
- AP/Kai: Windows Phone browser's HTML5 touch API support matter 
          examined. Due to the findings, we are currently planning
          to use Opera as the target browser. Currently it exists
          for e.g. Android and Symbian mobile devices (WP support
          may come later on this year but we can not count on it
          during this spring 2012 course). Opera exists also
          for desktop environment, for e.g. the Windows OS and
          that is useful for us, too, for testing purposes.
          The primary target mobile device is planned to
          be an Android device, Samsung Galaxy Nexus. 
          If extra time exists, we might try to make our app to
          work on a WP device too (Nokia Lumia 800), with IE
          browser, but it would require extra coding and testing
          efforts, and Opera's WP support might anyway be published
          during this year, when the extra coding for WP platform
          could be unnecessary as we might get the our app to
          work on WP too later on, without an extra (IE browser
          related) coding effort.
          AP done and closed.

- From now on, Kai will write the weekly status reports in a
  combined culumative file instead of separate files.

- For more teamwork details, see the 2012-03-26 team 9 meeting
  minutes in the file 2012-03-26-Team9-meeting-minutes-v1.txt .

- AP/Kai: Windows Phone browser's touch API support matter 
          examined. (Detail discussion in the next team meeting
          when the whole team is again together in Greater
          Helsinki City area 2012-03-26 and decision after that
